1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,119
Containers are linux technology

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:09,927
that allow you to package and isolate applications

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,682
along with their entire runtime environment.

4
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:16,283
Container images package all the libraries

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,533
and dependencies and application needs

6
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,087
so you can ship a complete application as one package.

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,845
Containers don't require an entire operating system

8
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:24,345
like VMs do.

9
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:28,286
Only the exact components it needs in order to operate.

10
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:31,160
This provides ease of deployment for operations

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,544
and confidence for developers that their application will run the same

12
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:37,250
on many different platforms or operating systems
