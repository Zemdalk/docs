1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,860
Let me think about that ...

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,060
How I'd best describe it?

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,900
So perhaps think of your existing applications

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,840
as this old place.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,320
For a long time people there were happy.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,680
They came up with new ideas.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,320
They were productive.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,420
And everything prospered.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,820
But then things started to change.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,960
People needed new ideas faster.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,420
Applications were built in a traditional way

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,100
you'd call them "monolithic".

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,040
In simple words they were just big

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,800
and complex and a little bit nasty.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Hard to manage and maintain.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,780
Incredibly difficult to get people excited

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,800
to work on developing new services

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,120
and transforming organizations.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,960
Then they heard of a place where

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,020
new ideas flourished and people were excited

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,640
to bring them to life.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,580
This is the land of cloud native application development.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,000
They were collaborating with each other a lot more.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,800
They were bringing new innovation and new ideas out.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,940
You didn't feel like, you know, when you were

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,960
in these places you were always responding to change,

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,540
you were the change.

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,780
It's DevOps.

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,080
It's containers.

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,560
It's microservices.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,860
And it's hybrid cloud.

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,580
It's really about changing your mindset

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,260
to embrace, you know, what's important with regard

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,440
to building application services quicker.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,460
At Red Hat, we help organizations

36
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,480
make strides in all of these areas and go

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,400
from spending the majority of their time

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,580
focused on maintenance,

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,580
to prioritizing building new things

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,340
and growing their businesses.

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,540
And that is cloud native app development.
